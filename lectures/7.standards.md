- What are standards for?
- Overview on a quality standard _ISO 9001:2015_
- Avionics Standards Structure
- IEC 61508: Industrial Process Management Framework

## What do standards do?

Mandate certain qualities of processes and products to:

- **Promote industrial and market efficiency**: level playing field. companies can't compete unfairly by producing inferior products that don't meet the standard.
- **Foster international trade**: internatinoal standards agreed and accepted in all countries fosters international trade
- **Lower barriers to market entry**
- **Diffuse new technologies**: if new technology has an agreed standard this de-risks the purchaser (other suppliers/products available)
- **Protect human safety/security and the environment**: ensure not harmful to humans/environment. Involves balancing cost against level of harm

## ISO 9001:2015 is a generic standard

- **ISO**: International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO is actually a French name)
- 160 member National Standards Organisations
- Some key standards:
  - ISO 9001: Quality Management Systems (QMS)
  - ISO 14001: Environment MS (EMS)
  - ISO 27001: Information Security MS (ISMS)
- ISO 9001:
  - International consenus on good practice
  - Focusses on meeting customer requirements and other stakeholders
  - Places requirements on organisations
  - Covers any organisation regardless of size, sector, culture, etc.

## ISO 9001:2015 in operation

- Sets _what_ must be achieved, but doesn't say _how_
- QMSs (quality management systems) will vary a lot across organisations
- Is a tool for management to manage quality effectively
- QMS that comply with this standard are often preferred or mandated for procurement. If the org is compliant then the suppliers must be compliant too (this can be a significant competitive advantage)
