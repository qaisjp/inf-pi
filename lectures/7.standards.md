## What do standards do?

Mandate certain qualities of processes and products to:

- **Promote industrial and market efficiency**: level playing field. companies can't compete unfairly by producing inferior products that don't meet the standard.
- **Foster international trade**: internatinoal standards agreed and accepted in all countries fosters international trade
- **Lower barriers to market entry**
- **Diffuse new technologies**: if new technology has an agreed standard this de-risks the purchaser (other suppliers/products available)
- **Protect human safety/security and the environment**: ensure not harmful to humans/environment. Involves balancing cost against level of harm
